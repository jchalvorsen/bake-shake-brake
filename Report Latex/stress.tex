\section{Stress}

The code has so far only calculated the displacement in the geometry. We will now look at the stress $\bm{\sigma}$ which measures how much forces per area are acting on a particular spatial point. 

To calculate the stress in 3 dimensions, we used the stress matrices from \cite{stressMatrix}.
