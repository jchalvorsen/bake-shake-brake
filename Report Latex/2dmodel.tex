\section{Presentation of 2D model}

A 2D solver for the linear elasticity problem is made using the finite element method. The domain $\Omega$ is divided into triangles, called elements, each with 3 edges or nodes. Each node represents an entry in the displacement vector

\begin{equation}
\bm{u}(x,y) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
u_x \\
u_y
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

which represents how much each spatial point has moved. We will also look at the strain $\bm{\epsilon}$ and stress $\bm{\sigma}$, which measures the deformation and the forces per area acting on a spatial point, respectively. We will not go into detail in 2D, but refer to the PART 2 note.
