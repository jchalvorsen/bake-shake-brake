\section{Challenges}
Throughout the process, we did face some challenges. We will here present some of the most important ones. When making the load vector in 3 dimensions, we forgot to map load vector to the right nodes. This resulted in weird displacements, see Figure \ref{fig:queens}, and took quite some time to figure out what was wrong.

                \caption{The same chess queen with the correct boundary conditions.}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{We see that the queen deforms quite badly when dealing with the wrong boundary conditions. }

Also, the matrix \eqref{eq:C} is only valid for an isotropic media, and is thus not valid for wood. Realizing this a little too late, we conclude that the exact same analysis could have been done with steel, which is isotropic. We also encountered a lot of computational challenges. We tried to run our algorithm on the Sydney Harbour bridge, see Figure \ref{fig:picBridge}, but $N = 274.461$ nodes was too large, and matlab ran out of memory.
