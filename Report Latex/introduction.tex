\section{Introduction}



The linear elasticity equation

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:linEl}
\nabla \bm{\sigma}(\bm{u}) = - \bm{f}.
\end{equation}

describes deformation and motion on a solid object. In this report, we will present how the linear elasticity equation is applied to a geometry in 3D using the finite element method. We will look at the convergence rate on our methods, and visualize how a bridge is deformed when a car drives over it. We will also look at stress on the bridge and explain parts of our algorithm. Finally, a brief discussion about reducing the computational load is performed.
